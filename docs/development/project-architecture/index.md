The Synmetrix project is organized following a modular and scalable architecture that enables users to manage and execute machine learning experiments effectively. This overview provides insights into the project's code structure and architecture.

### Code Structure

The codebase of Synmetrix is structured as follows:

#### 1. **Root Directory**

   - Contains project-level configuration files, such as `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and `.gitattributes`.
   - Houses the top-level scripts for managing the project.

#### 2. **`synmetrix/` Directory**

   - The core directory containing the Synmetrix application code.
   - Subdirectories include:
     - `api/`: Implements the API server responsible for handling requests and routing them to the appropriate services.
     - `app/`: Contains the user interface (UI) code, including web application components.
     - `services/`: Houses various backend services, such as experiment management, dataset management, and model management.
     - `common/`: Provides common utilities, shared functions, and configurations used throughout the project.
     - `database/`: Manages interactions with the metadata database and data storage.
     - `scripts/`: Contains scripts for project management and automation.
     - `tests/`: Stores unit and integration tests for code verification.
     - `docs/`: Contains documentation source files.

#### 3. **`config/` Directory**

   - Contains configuration files for different environments, including development and production.
   - Provides settings for database connections, authentication, and other application-specific configurations.

#### 4. **`docker/` Directory**

   - Contains Docker-related files for containerization and deployment.
   - Includes Docker Compose configuration files for defining multi-container applications.

### Architecture Overview

The Synmetrix project follows a microservices-based architecture, where different components handle specific tasks and communicate via APIs. Key architectural components include:

#### 1. **User Interface (UI)**

   - The UI is implemented as a web application using modern web technologies.
   - Users interact with the platform through the UI to create, manage, and monitor machine learning experiments.

#### 2. **API Server**

   - The API server serves as the central communication hub, receiving and processing requests from the UI and external clients.
   - It handles user authentication, authorization, and routing of requests to the relevant backend services.

#### 3. **Backend Services**

   - Backend services manage critical aspects of the Synmetrix platform, including:
     - Experiment Management: Scheduling, monitoring, and result storage for machine learning experiments.
     - Dataset Management: Storage, retrieval, and preprocessing of datasets.
     - Model Management: Version control, deployment, and monitoring of machine learning models.
     - User Management: Authentication, authorization, and profile management.
     - Notification Service: Real-time notifications for experiment status and activities.
     - Logging and Monitoring: Collects logs and metrics for system health and performance analysis.

#### 4. **Compute Resources**

   - Synmetrix utilizes distributed computing resources (e.g., cloud instances) to execute machine learning experiments in parallel.
   - GPU support is available for deep learning tasks that require accelerated computation.

#### 5. **Database Layer**

   - The metadata database stores critical information about experiments, datasets, models, users, and other system entities.
   - Data storage components manage raw and preprocessed datasets used in experiments.

#### 6. **Machine Learning Libraries and Frameworks**

   - Synmetrix leverages popular machine learning libraries and frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn for machine learning and deep learning tasks.

#### 7. **External Integrations**

   - Synmetrix integrates with external data sources and services for tasks such as data importing and preprocessing.

#### 8. **Security and Authentication**

   - Security measures include user authentication, authorization, data encryption, and access controls to ensure data privacy and security.

#### 9. **Monitoring and Logging**

   - The platform employs logging and monitoring to capture logs for debugging, auditing, and compliance, as well as to monitor system health and resource utilization.

#### 10. **Scalability and High Availability**

   - Load balancing and auto-scaling mechanisms ensure the platform can handle increased demand while maintaining high availability.

#### 11. **Deployment and Containerization**

   - Containerization technologies like Docker are used for consistent and portable deployments.
   - Orchestration tools like Kubernetes help manage containerized services.

#### 12. **DevOps and CI/CD**

   - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate testing, building, and deployment processes.

#### 13. **Documentation**

   - User and developer documentation provide guidance on platform usage and extension.
