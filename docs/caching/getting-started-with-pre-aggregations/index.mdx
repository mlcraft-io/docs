Often at the beginning of an analytical application's lifecycle - when there is
a smaller dataset that queries execute over - the application works well and
delivers responses within acceptable thresholds. However, as the size of the
dataset grows, the time-to-response from a user's perspective can often suffer
quite heavily. This is true of both application and purpose-built data
warehousing solutions.

This leaves us with a chicken-and-egg problem; application databases can deliver
low-latency responses with small-to-large datasets, but struggle with massive
analytical datasets; data warehousing solutions _usually_ make no guarantees
except to deliver a response, which means latency can vary wildly on a
query-to-query basis.

| Database Type                  | Low Latency? | Massive Datasets? |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Application (Postgres/MySQL)   | ✅            | ❌                 |
| Analytical (BigQuery/Redshift) | ❌            | ✅                 |


Cube provides a solution to this problem: pre-aggregations. In layman's terms, a
pre-aggregation is a condensed version of the source data. It specifies
ttributes from the source, which Cube uses to condense (or crunch) the data.
This simple yet powerful optimization can reduce the size of the dataset by
several orders of magnitude, and ensures subsequent queries can be served by the
same condensed dataset if any matching attributes are found.

[Pre-aggregations are defined within each cube's data
schema][ref-schema-preaggs], and cubes can have as many pre-aggregations as they
require. The pre-aggregated data [can be stored either alongside the source data
in the same database, in an external database][ref-caching-preaggs-storage] that
is supported by Cube, [or in Cube Store, a dedicated pre-aggregation storage
layer][ref-caching-preaggs-cubestore].

## Pre-Aggregations without Time Dimension

To illustrate pre-aggregations with an example, let's use a sample e-commerce
database. We have a data model representing all our `orders`:

Some sample data from this table might look like:


| **id** | **status** | **completed_at**        |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| 1      | completed  | 2021-02-15T12:21:11.290 |
| 2      | completed  | 2021-02-25T18:15:12.369 |
| 3      | shipped    | 2021-03-15T20:40:57.404 |
| 4      | processing | 2021-03-13T10:30:21.360 |
| 5      | completed  | 2021-03-10T18:25:32.109 |


Our first requirement is to populate a dropdown in our front-end application
which shows all possible statuses. The Cube query to retrieve this information
might look something like:
