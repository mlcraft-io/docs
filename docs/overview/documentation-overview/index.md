# Documentation Overview

## Introduction

This documentation serves as a comprehensive resource for the Synmetrix project, formerly known as MLcraft. Synmetrix is an open-source platform designed to streamline and simplify machine learning operations, enabling data scientists and engineers to build, deploy, and manage machine learning models efficiently.

## Problem Statement

Machine learning operations (ML ops) present various challenges for organizations and data professionals. These challenges include:

- **Complex Model Deployment**: Deploying machine learning models in production environments can be complex and error-prone.

- **Model Monitoring**: Monitoring model performance, data drift, and maintaining model quality over time is challenging.

- **Collaboration**: Collaborating on ML projects and managing access to resources can be cumbersome.

- **Versioning**: Versioning and tracking changes in machine learning models and data is crucial but often poorly managed.

- **Scalability**: As data and model complexities grow, scaling ML operations becomes a significant concern.

## Synmetrix Solution

Synmetrix addresses these challenges by providing a unified platform for ML ops. Its key features include:

- **Model Versioning**: Easily manage and version machine learning models.

- **Streamlined Deployment**: Simplify the deployment of ML models in production.

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor model performance and data quality in real time, with alerting capabilities.

- **Collaboration**: Facilitate collaboration among data scientists, engineers, and stakeholders.

- **Customization**: Highly customizable to adapt to various ML workflows and use cases.
