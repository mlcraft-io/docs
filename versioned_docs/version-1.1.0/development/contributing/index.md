This guide provides information on how to contribute to Synmetrix, including code changes, helping other users, documentation updates, bug reports, bug fixes, new feature proposals, and coding standards.

Contributions to Synmetrix go beyond code development. Assisting new users, testing releases, improving documentation, and participating in discussions are all valuable ways to contribute to the community.

## Helping Other Users

One of the most valuable ways to contribute to Synmetrix is by helping answer user questions on the [discussion forum](https://github.com/mlcraft-io/mlcraft/discussions) or in the [Slack channel](https://join.mlcraft-io/mlcraft.com/t/mlcraft/shared_invite/zt-1x2gxwn37-J3tTvCR5xSFVfxwUU_YKtg"). There are always new Synmetrix users seeking assistance, and providing answers is a valuable community service that showcases your expertise.

## Contributing to Documentation

To propose changes to Synmetrix documentation, edit the documentation source files located in the [docs/](https://github.com/mlcraft-io/mlcraft/tree/master/docs) directory. The README file there explains how to build the documentation locally to test your changes. After making modifications, open a pull request to suggest the changes.

## Reporting Bugs

Reporting a bug is a simple and effective way to contribute to Synmetrix. It helps identify issues, enabling the team to provide patches and enhance the stability and usefulness of Synmetrix. Use the "New issue" button in the [issues page](https://github.com/mlcraft-io/mlcraft/issues) to report a bug. Ensure your bug report includes a minimal executable test case to replicate the issue. Follow the instructions in the bug report template provided.

## Contributing Bug Fixes

Contributing bug fixes is an excellent way to build your experience and credibility within the community. If you are new to the Synmetrix codebase, start by looking at issues labeled with [help wanted](https://github.com/mlcraft-io/mlcraft/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). If you need guidance on fixing an issue, seek assistance from experienced contributors by commenting on the issue page.

## Proposing New Features

Before contributing a new feature, submit a proposal in the [issues page](https://github.com/mlcraft-io/mlcraft/issues) and discuss it with the community. This helps identify potential overlaps with planned features and prevents misunderstandings and conflicts.

## Submitting Code Changes

When submitting code contributions, you must sign a [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) to certify your authorship of the source code or your right to submit it to the project. Sign your contributions by adding a `Signed-off-by` line to your commit message or using the `-s` option with the [git commit command](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits/).
